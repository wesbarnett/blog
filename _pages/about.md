I solve business problems through the end-to-end implementation of machine learning
products. I currently am in a senior machine learning engineer role at a company in the finance
industry. Before my current role I was a fellow with Insight Data Science where I
created [a Chrome Extension](https://github.com/wesbarnett/insight) to predict where a
user would post their content.

I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Mississippi State University, an MDiv from
New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, and a PhD in Chemical & Molecular Engineering
from Tulane University.

My graduate research utilized programming, data science, and
molecular simulations to study self-assembling molecules. After receiving my PhD, I
worked as a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University where I studied
polymer interactions and gas separation membranes using molecular simulations and
machine learning. [My list of research publications is
