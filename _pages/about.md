I solve business problems through the end-to-end implementation of machine learning
products.

I received a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Mississippi State University. Later, I
received a PhD in Chemical & Molecular Engineering from Tulane University where the
focus on my research was on molecular simulations. After that I was a postdoctoral
research scientist at Columbia University where I studied polymer interactions using
molecular simulations and machine learning.

More recently I was a fellow with Insight Data Science where I created a Chrome
Extension to predict where a user would post their content. I currently am in a senior
machine learning engineer role at a financial company.
