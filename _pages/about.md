I solve business problems through the end-to-end implementation of machine learning
products.

I received a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Mississippi State University. Later, I
received a PhD in Chemical & Molecular Engineering from Tulane University my research
utilized programming, data science, and molecular simulations to study self-assembling
molecules. After that I was a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University
where I studied polymer interactions and gas separation membranes using molecular
simulations and machine learning.

More recently I was a fellow with Insight Data Science where I created [a Chrome
Extension](https://github.com/wesbarnett/insight) to predict where a user would post
their content. I currently am in a senior machine learning engineer role at a financial
company.
