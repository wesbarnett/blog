During the process of going through the fast.ai course, I decided to build my own deep
learning box. A couple of decades ago as a teenager I remember my brother ordering parts
and putting together the family's PC. Of course at the time it was used mainly for
playing Alpha Centauri, downloading from Napster, and racking up the long distance phone
bill not knowing area codes did not mean local calling. I also got exposed to HTML and
Javascript at the time so that was my first real introduction to any kind of coding
(Javascript has changed just a little since then).

I remember my brother using a website PC Parts Picker to put a list of compatible parts
together and find where to buy them. That website is still commonly used today and what
I used in picking my parts. [This is the list I ended up
with](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XJBpmg). (Note: Some items are now discontinued by
the time you're reading this). The important thing for me was to get an Nvidia card to
be able to properly use CUDA on my machine. The card is on the lower end of what is
considered acceptable, but I was on a budget.

Here are most of the parts in their boxes before assembling.
